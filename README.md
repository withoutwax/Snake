# Snake üêç
Classic Snake Game created with JavaScript.  

## Features
- Need to add something here

## Original Story
Snake game is a special game for me as it was my very first programming project done back in 2016, done with Processing. You can check the original game [here](https://github.com/withoutwax/Snake-Game).   
After creating my original game, I thought it would be nice to re-build the game with JavaScript so that I can host it on the web with my friends to play, and compete with each other. Also I thought it would be good practice to improve my JavaScript skill.

## Implementation
The Snake is heavily Object Oriented, using native prototypical inheritance system.   
The game tries to capture the color scheme and vibe of the original game. These features are subject to develop in the future.
